# NB (Forkers/contributors):

This repository is currently in the process of undergoing safety and Flutter version upgrades. Expect major merge conflicts in the near future for any files updated from this repository. Please note that this software is under active development and provided "as is" without warranties or guarantees. Use at your own risk, as the authors and maintainers shall not be held liable for any issues, damages, or losses resulting from its use.

## Getting Started

Build requires up-to-date version of coins file from https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins

Commit hash and sha256sum of coins file is specified in `coins_ci.json`.
You may download one manually or use `fetch_coins.sh` script on Linux and macOS or `fetch_coins.ps1` PowerShell script on Windows.

The `fetch_coins` script depends on sha256sum and jq utils:

Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y coreutils jq`

MacOS: `brew install coreutils jq`, [Brew software](https://brew.sh/)

Windows: `choco install jq`, [Choco software](https://chocolatey.org/)


## Build and run

https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/AtomicDEX-mobile/wiki/Project-Setup#build-and-run

### Build with docker

To build from a container without installing Flutter on an x86_64 machine (Linux or Windows) with Docker or Podman installed, you can use the provided Dockerfile.

```bash
sh .docker/build_apk_release.sh
```

You can also manually build using docker with the following commands:

```bash
docker build -f .docker/android-sdk.dockerfile . -t komodo/android-sdk:34
docker build -f .docker/android-apk-build.dockerfile . -t komodo/komodo-wallet-mobile
docker run --rm -v ./build:/app/build komodo/komodo-wallet-mobile:latest
```

The build output should be in the following directory: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

NOTE: There are known issues with building this repository using docker on ARM-based systems (e.g. M-series Macs, Raspberry Pi):
 - linux/amd64: [Dart VM emulation on M1 Mac fails](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/48420)
 - linux/arm64: fails due to dependencies limiting the versions of the dart sdk, android gradle plugin, and gradle build tools. See the [Gradle Compatibility Matrix](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html)

## Run/Build with screenshot and video recording ON

```
flutter run --dart-define=screenshot=true
```


## Komodo DeFi Framework Library Setup:

Komodo Wallet runs the Komodo DeFi Framework locally on the user's device. The API binary is platform-specific and must be manually set up by the developer instead of a typical Flutter dependency.

Ensure you run the most recent Komodo DeFi Framework [stable release](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/releases). Download the API binary for each platform and extract its `libmm2.a` file into the applicable platform's API folder.



### [Stable API releases](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/releases)
 
| API Build | API Path* |
|--|--|
| android-aarch64 | `android/app/src/main/cpp/libs/arm64-v8a/libmm2.a` |
| android-armv7 | `android/app/src/main/cpp/libs/armeabi-v7a/libmm2.a` |
| iOS | `ios/libmm2.a` |

**Relative to the Flutter project's root folder. E.g. if your name was Bob and you cloned the flutter project into your macOS home directory, the full path for the iOS API would be `/Users/Bob/atomicdex_mobile/ios/libmm2.a`*

See [our wiki](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicdex-mobile/wiki/Project-Setup#android-builds-from-scratch) here for more thorough project setup steps. Besides installing the API binary, Komodo Wallet is set up similarly to any other cloned Flutter project.

### Setup with Python script

You can use the provided Python script to download and extract the API binary for you. This script will download the latest release of the API binary from GitHub and extract it to the correct location.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r .docker/requirements.txt
python .docker/update_api.py --force
```

## Accessing the database

    adb exec-out run-as com.komodoplatform.atomicdex cat /data/data/com.komodoplatform.atomicdex/app_flutter/AtomicDEX.db > AtomicDEX.db
    sqlite3 AtomicDEX.db

## Localization

1. Extract messages to the .arb file:
```bash
flutter pub run intl_generator:extract_to_arb --output-dir=lib/l10n lib/localizations.dart
```
2. Sync generated `intl_messages.arb` with existing locale `intl_*.arb` files:
```bash
dart run sync_arb_files.dart
```
3. ARB files can be used for input to translation tools like [Arbify](https://github.com/Arbify/Arbify), [Localizely](https://localizely.com/) etc.
4. The resulting translations can be used to generate a set of libraries:
```bash
flutter pub run intl_generator:generate_from_arb --output-dir=lib/l10n  lib/localizations.dart lib/l10n/intl_*.arb
```
5. Manual editing of generated `messages_*.dart` files might be needed to delete nullable syntax (`?` symbol), since the app doesn't support it yet.

## Generate latest coin config:

Clone the latest version of [coins](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins)

Download and install the latest version of [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Open the cloned repository and run the script below in the terminal in the repo folder.

```bash
python3 utils/generate_app_configs.py
```

Copy the generated `coins_config.json` file from the Utils folder and paste it inside the `assets/` folder in the Komodo Wallet project.
