# NB (Forkers/contributors)

This repository is currently in the process of undergoing safety and Flutter version upgrades. Expect major merge conflicts in the near future for any files updated from this repository. Please note that this software is under active development and provided "as is" without warranties or guarantees. Use at your own risk, as the authors and maintainers shall not be held liable for any issues, damages, or losses resulting from its use.

## Getting Started

Build requires up-to-date version of coins file from <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins>

Commit hash and sha256sum of coins file is specified in `coins_ci.json`.
You may download one manually, use the `fetch_coin_assets.py` python script.

The `fetch_coin_assets.py` script requires python 3.8 or later. MacOS users might need to run the [following post-install commands](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42334357/5019115) for SSL certificate verification to work with their version of python:

```bash
pip install certifi
/Applications/Python\ 3.12/Install\ Certificates.command
```

## Build and run

<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/AtomicDEX-mobile/wiki/Project-Setup#build-and-run>

## Run/Build with screenshot and video recording ON

```
flutter run --dart-define=screenshot=true
```

## Komodo DeFi Framework Library Setup

Komodo Wallet runs the Komodo DeFi Framework locally on the user's device. The API binary is platform-specific and must be manually set up by the developer instead of a typical Flutter dependency.

Ensure you run the most recent Komodo DeFi Framework [stable release](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/releases). Download the API binary for each platform and extract its `libmm2.a` file into the applicable platform's API folder.

### [Stable API releases](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/releases)

| API Build | API Path* |
|--|--|
| android-aarch64 | `android/app/src/main/cpp/libs/arm64-v8a/libmm2.a` |
| android-armv7 | `android/app/src/main/cpp/libs/armeabi-v7a/libmm2.a` |
| iOS | `ios/libmm2.a` |

**Relative to the Flutter project's root folder. E.g. if your name was Bob and you cloned the flutter project into your macOS home directory, the full path for the iOS API would be `/Users/Bob/atomicdex_mobile/ios/libmm2.a`*

See [our wiki](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicdex-mobile/wiki/Project-Setup#android-builds-from-scratch) here for more thorough project setup steps. Besides installing the API binary, Komodo Wallet is set up similarly to any other cloned Flutter project.

## Accessing the database

    adb exec-out run-as com.komodoplatform.atomicdex cat /data/data/com.komodoplatform.atomicdex/app_flutter/AtomicDEX.db > AtomicDEX.db
    sqlite3 AtomicDEX.db

## Localization

1. Extract messages to the .arb file:

```bash
flutter pub run intl_generator:extract_to_arb --output-dir=lib/l10n lib/localizations.dart
```

2. Sync generated `intl_messages.arb` with existing locale `intl_*.arb` files:

```bash
dart run sync_arb_files.dart
```

3. ARB files can be used for input to translation tools like [Arbify](https://github.com/Arbify/Arbify), [Localizely](https://localizely.com/) etc.
4. The resulting translations can be used to generate a set of libraries:

```bash
flutter pub run intl_generator:generate_from_arb --output-dir=lib/l10n  lib/localizations.dart lib/l10n/intl_*.arb
```

5. Manual editing of generated `messages_*.dart` files might be needed to delete nullable syntax (`?` symbol), since the app doesn't support it yet.

## Generate latest coin config

Clone the latest version of [coins](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins)

Download and install the latest version of [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Open the cloned repository and run the script below in the terminal in the repo folder.

```bash
python3 utils/generate_app_configs.py
```

Copy the generated `coins_config.json` file from the Utils folder and paste it inside the `assets/` folder in the Komodo Wallet project.
