  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
  - assets/
  - assets/branding/
  - assets/branding/svg/
  - assets/audio/
  - assets/mocks/
  - assets/currency-flags/
  - assets/language-flags/
  - assets/coin-icons/
  - assets/svg/
  - assets/svg_light/
  - assets/swap_share/
  - assets/coins.json
  - assets/coins_config.json
  - assets/rebranding/

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Ubuntu
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Ubuntu/Ubuntu-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: fonts/Ubuntu/Ubuntu-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: fonts/Ubuntu/Ubuntu-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: fonts/Ubuntu/Ubuntu-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
        - asset: fonts/Ubuntu/Ubuntu-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
    - family: Monospace
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Monospace/RobotoMono-Regular.ttf
